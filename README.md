# HouseAlert

## What is HouseAlert ?

Our application is a Python-based web scraper that **monitors rental listings on real estate agency** websites in **Paris, France**. Users can set their preferred criteria, such as location, price range, number of bedrooms, and other amenities. The scraper runs periodically to check for new listings that match the user's criteria. When a new listing is found, the application sends an alert to the user via a Telegram bot.

The use of a Telegram bot for alerts ensures that users receive notifications in real time, even when they are not actively using the application.

Overall, our application is a convenient and effective way to stay up-to-date with the latest rental listings on real estate agency websites. It saves users time and effort by automating the search process and delivering relevant results directly to their Telegram inbox.
